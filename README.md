# ft_linear_regression
42 machine learning project. (on going)

# formula that we need for this project

1. Hypothesis(H theta(x)) -> theta0 + (theta1 * x)

2. Cost function -> (1 / 2m) sum(m, i=1) * (hypothesis(x(i)) - y(i))

3. Gradient Descent -> theta(j) - LearningRate * Cost function

# Definition of the therme

- 'x & y' are a value of our data set

- 'm' is the size of our data set

- 'i' is the index of where we are in our data set

- LearningRate is the coefficient of the learning.

# Lets' see all of that with a simple schema
